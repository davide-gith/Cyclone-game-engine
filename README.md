# 🌪️ Cyclone Game Engine
This repository contains an ongoing implementation of the **Cyclone Game Engine**, developed in **C++** by following *Ian Millington’s "Game Physics Engine Development"* book.  
The project focuses on building a physics engine from the ground up, with a strong emphasis on **rigid body dynamics**, **forces**, **constraints**, and **collision handling**.

## 📚 Learning Goals
This project is not just a codebase, but also a **practical learning exercise**.  
Through this engine, I am improving my skills in:
- C++ programming and object-oriented design.  
- Physics simulation for games and interactive applications.  
- Mathematical foundations for rigid body dynamics.  
- Building reusable, extensible software architectures.
